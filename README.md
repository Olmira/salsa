# Salsa
This is the place for experimentations.

## The setup (only once)
 - Fork the main(upstream) repository to your private GitHub account
 - Setup the link to upstream repository
 - Clone the repository to your own computer
 - Create your own experimentation Playground on the platform
 - Upload files from your computer's */src/* folder to your playground

## The process!
 - Before starting to experiment fetch updates from the upstream to update your local repository
 - Synchronize fetched files on your computer with your private repository on GitHub
 - If updates are fetched, Upload new files from your computer's */src/* folder to your playground
 - Experiment and edit the files on your Playground
 - If anything changed online, download files from the PCt platform to your local repository again
 - Commit locally on your computer, specifying comments about changes that you have made
 - Push to your local fork on GitHub repository to ensure backup
 - Make pull request on the GitHub website to synchronize upstream with your private fork repository
